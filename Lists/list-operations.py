# The + operator concatenates lists:

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
c = a + b
print(c)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# Similarly, the * operator repeats a list a given number of times:

[0] * 4
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 2, 3] * 3
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
# # The first example repeats four times. The second example repeats the list three times.
